# AndroidMVC
Library AAR to be used on Android from version API-16. This library defines a multipage Activity that contains Fragments that auto populate a List View with model data coming from a custom data source (be it an external source, database, room database or any other data storage). The library provides the framework to connect the model instances to the Android view renderers using an interactive enabled controller. List expansion/collapse, render layout change depending on context or automatic view update when model changes are out of the box requiring minimal code from developers. Tested on old Android versions and with minimal dependencies to other libraries. Current test code implementation and extension to support custom view non list models.
